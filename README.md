# Solving LeetCode Problems

What is it about these type of micro-algorithm problems? They're quite fun in the same way that a crossword is fun. I'm not sure there are a healthy or effective way to be a better software engineer but they are a pretty decent way to exercise a mental skillset that is rarely exercised in day-to-day work. I'm not saying that professional software engineers don't encounter problems like these as a part of their work, but the environmental factors are considerably different. First, these type of problems are seldom novel. Second, when they do come up, the constraints of the solution you produce are far different. First, it pays to spend a bit more time solving the problem to ensure that it is both efficent and understandable. Making the solution understandable is the hard part, in most cases. I'm a little perplexed why people use these type of problems during technical interviews. I would expect that to bias in favor of young candidates who, by virtue of having relatively recently been in a college environment, are still conditioned to the myopia required to solve these quickly.

But I digress. They're fun and in this repository, I will on occassion solve one or two problems.
